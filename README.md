# OpenSearch Assistant Dashboards

The OpenSearch Assistant Dashboards plugin lets you have an opensearch assistant to help dashboards users use OpenSearch.

## How to get started

See [getting started guide](GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) to how to deploy this Assistant on your machine with docker images.
**Note** that the `feature/langchain` is the branch used in the getting started guide.

### Supported tools
This requires setting `assistant.chat.enabled` to `true` in `opensearch_dashboards.yml` to use these skills:
1. Query OpenSearch: Use to generate and run a PPL Query to get results for a generic user question related to data stored in their OpenSearch cluster.
2. Get log info: Use to get information of logs if the question contains an OpenSearch log index.
3. Get log error info: Use to get information of logs with errors if the question contains an OpenSearch log index.
4. Search Alerting Monitors By Index: Use this tool to search alerting monitors by index name in the OpenSearch cluster.
5. Get All Alerts: Use this tool to search all alerts triggered in the OpenSearch cluster.
6. Get ticket information: Use this tool to find tickets in the system with incidents that are relevant to a question about error causes. 
7. Get generic information: Use this tool to answer a generic question not related to OpenSearch cluster. This tool takes the question as input.
8. Get OpenSearch indices: Use this tool to get high-level information (e. health, status, index, docs.count) about indices in a cluster, including backing indices for data streams in the OpenSearch cluster.
9. Check OpenSearch index existence: Use this tool to check if a data stream, index, or alias exists in the OpenSearch cluster.
10. Find Visualizations: Use this tool to find user created visualizations.
